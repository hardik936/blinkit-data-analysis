# blinkit-data-analysis
Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Blinkitâ€™s operational data to uncover insights and propose solutions to business problems. Blinkit, a quick-commerce platform, generates vast amounts of transactional and operational data. The goal was to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) to understand sales trends, outlet performance, and product preferences, ultimately providing actionable recommendations to optimize business operations.

The analysis was performed using Python for data processing and visualization, SQL for querying and aggregating data, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. The project focused on five KPIs:





Total Sales by Fat Content: Sales distribution across low-fat and regular-fat products.



Total Sales by Item Type: Sales performance across different product categories.



Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales: Sales breakdown by fat content for each outlet.



Total Sales by Outlet Establishment: Sales trends based on the year outlets were established.



Sales by Outlet Size: Sales performance across small, medium, and large outlets.
Objectives





Identify sales patterns and trends to inform inventory and marketing strategies.



Evaluate outlet performance to optimize resource allocation.



Provide data-driven recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction and profitability.

Tools and Technologies





Python: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).





Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.



SQL: Used for querying the dataset to extract and aggregate data for analysis.





Tools: MySQL/PostgreSQL (assumed based on standard SQL usage).



Power BI: Used to create interactive dashboards for visualizing KPIs and sharing insights with stakeholders.



Jupyter Notebook: For documenting Python-based analysis and visualizations.



Git: For version control and collaboration.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)





Total Sales by Fat Content:





Analyzed sales distribution between low-fat and regular-fat products to understand customer preferences.



Insight: Low-fat products may appeal to health-conscious customers, influencing inventory decisions.



Total Sales by Item Type:





Examined sales across product categories (e.g., snacks, dairy, fruits) to identify top-performing items.



Insight: High-demand categories can guide promotional strategies.



Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:





Investigated how sales of low-fat vs. regular-fat products vary across outlets.



Insight: Certain outlets may cater to specific customer segments, informing targeted marketing.



Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:





Analyzed sales based on the year outlets were established to assess performance of newer vs. older outlets.



Insight: Older outlets may have higher sales due to established customer bases.



Sales by Outlet Size:





Compared sales across small, medium, and large outlets to evaluate operational efficiency.



Insight: Larger outlets may generate higher sales but require more resources.
